This repository contains the file from Tableau Product Training and Tableau Course by Kirril@udemy.

I experimented all these files till the time my Tableau license was valid. The license was given by upGrad.

Tableau has 2 products one is for data clean, data preperation called TableauPre.

Tableau is an excellent tool for data visualization. But it is costly licensing. $75/month. If you have regular work assignment then you can go for a yearly license.

Taleau uses LOD (Level of Detail) expressions to design complex visualization or simple visulziation from complex data.
